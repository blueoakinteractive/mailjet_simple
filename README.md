# Mailjet Simple Drupal Module

Provides a simple integration of contacts and contact lists using the Mailjet API.

When registering with Drupal or editing their account, users have the ability
to select which lists they'd like to be subscribed to. The lists that are available
can be configured from the admin settings page. 

This module was created because the existing mailjet module was overly complicated
(for our needs) and under developed.

Cheers!
